## 1: Overview

**Statistical-Learning** is a personal learning repository built around the book [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python*](https://www.statlearning.com/). This project documents my deep dive into statistical learning, combining theoretical concepts with practical coding exercises.

The goal is to gain both **intuitive understanding** and **hands-on proficiency** in statistical and machine learning methods.



## 2: Repository Structure

- `ch##-topic/` folders contains:
    - `ch##-topic-lab.ipynb` - This is the lab written by the authors of ISLP
    - `ch##_exercises.ipynb` - This is the code with the end of chapter *applied questions*. 
- `data/` - Contains all of the data for ILSP (downloaded from the website)
- `images/` - Contains source images
